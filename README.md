<p>A little 16bit platformer using GoDot engine. Still under development. Very small but cute. Extensible. Built with GoDot Engine and a looot of fun.
</p>

### Starting the Game:

First install GoDot engine 3. Then install this repo with the green button on the upper-right side of this page. After you've done this part, you should make shure that you've installed the.zip folder locally, so you can import it with GoDot.
 Since GoDot is self-contained you don not nead to pre-install this game. It runs synchronous and quiet on an .exe file. 

### Developing on the Game:

For developing on this game, you'll need GoDot engine 3. Now follow these Steps.

1.  clone this Repository and extract the .zip folder using this command:

```bash
mkdir pig-extract
cd ./pig-extract
git clone http://timo-cmd/pig.git 
cd ./pig
```

2.  now open this directory with GoDot and start catching some bugs!

Please read contribution guidelines.
